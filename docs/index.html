    <h2>What is redlining?</h2>
    Redlining is defined by the Federal Reserve as the "practice of denying a creditworthy applicant a loan for housing in a certain neighborhood even though the applicant may otherwise be eligible for the loan". The practice is rooted in the historical action of mortgage lenders drawing 'red lines' around regions they did not want to offer loans to.
    Zones that were marked as high-risk loan areas, were also areas made up of majority people of color. The redlining system was primarily designed to protect white, middle-lower class families. Many people of color were forced into neighborhoods with poorer infrastructure, safety, and many urban housing projects.
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Who drew these lines?</h2>
    To answer this question we have to look at HOLC, or the Home Owners' Loan Corporation.
    HOLC hired mortgage lenders, appraisers, and developers to create color coded maps of loanable zones in many metropolitan areas. Each zone was given a grade from A-D. Grade A neighborhoods were deemed as "best" to grant loans to, and grade D neighborhoods were deemed as "hazardous" for loan approval. Many grade D zones were located in areas with high African American populations and higher populations of people of color.

    <h2>Understanding HOLC Grades</h2>
    Below is the descriptions of each HOLC grade, their names colored with their coordinating color on the map.
    Grade A (Best): Always upper- or upper-middle-class White neighborhoods that HOLC defined as posing minimal risk for banks and other mortgage lenders, as they were "ethnically homogeneous" and had room to be further developed.
    Grade B (Still Desirable): Generally nearly or completely White, U.S. -born neighborhoods that HOLC defined as "still desirable" and sound investments for mortgage lenders.
    Grade C (Declining): Areas where the residents were often working-class and/or first or second generation immigrants from Europe. These areas often lacked utilities and were characterized by older building stock.
    Grade D (Hazardous): Areas here often received this grade because they were "infiltrated" with "undesirable populations" such as Jewish, Asian, Mexican, and Black families. These areas were more likely to be close to industrial areas and to have older housing.

    <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
    We went back and forth a lot with the appropriate way to display this data, and what parameters we wanted to display in terms of the HOLC zones. We considered having a single map with a tooltip, that when you hovered over the zones all the data for that zone would be displayed. We did a lot of research for other visualization examples, specifically research that dealth with geographic "zones" similar to the HOLC ones, and their impact. 
    We arrived at the choice of a linked map because we figured the side by side would allow the users to draw their own conclusions about the coordinating data. Additionally, it proved complex to aggregate data by the geoData boundaries.

    <h2>Development Process</h2>
    The entire project probably took around 100 hours combined. 
    At first, a lot of our time was initally spent trying to figure out how to display geoData, something neither of us had done before. Both of us worked on this, and spent time in office hours until we reached a valid solution.
    The next step was searching for data that would combine well with the HOLC outlines. We worked on data searching individually before coming together and picking the data sets that made the most sent. This was worked on likely for 10 hours combined.
    Next, we had to decide on how to make the visualization interactive, which we spent a lot of down time on. This was likely the most challenging aspect of this project. We could not decide if we wanted to underlay an undisplayed map underneath the HOLC datasets. 
    Building the visualization and coding the side by side linked map took the most times. Grace did a lot of the grunt work on coding the side by side map. After Grace was done, Neha looked into how to integrate this side by side map with other sources. Most of our work involved pair programming, either together in person or through screensharing on zoom.
